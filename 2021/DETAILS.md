Announcing ... \*drumroll\* ... the **2021 Minetest GAME JAM**!  

This is the first "legit" game jam for the Minetest community, and we hope it brings a few new games to the collection. We also hope it goes well enough to host more of these in the future!  

[Why](#why-should-i-be-excited) | [What](#what-do-i-do) | [When](#when-is-it-happening) | [How](#how-do-i-participate) | [Ratings](#rating-and-scoring) | [Prizes](#what-will-i-win) | [Judges](#who-are-the-judges) | [Who](#whos-in-charge-of-this-thing)

## Why should I be excited?
* Sharpen your game making skills!
* Play new games made by the community!
* **[Money prizes!](#what-will-i-win)**
* It's fun, right???
* It's easy!

## What do I do?
Your goal is to **make a _small_, complete, self-contained experience**.  

Some examples of the size of game we are looking for:
* https://content.minetest.net/packages/Hume2/boxworld3d/
* https://content.minetest.net/packages/Just_Visiting/labyrinth/
* https://content.minetest.net/packages/1248/labyrinthus/

The goal is to make a small game, not an immersive sandbox or an emergent RPG. Choose a simple, manageable idea, and divide your time wisely.  

Need game ideas? How about:
* Racing game
* Farming simulator
* I Spy (or Where's Waldo?)
* Business simulation (tycoon game)
* Tower defense
* Battleship (or another board game)

## When is it happening?
_(All dates are 00:00UTC)_  
* The game jam starts **December 1st**.  
* Development time ends **December 21st**.
* Rating begins immediately after, and ends **December 30th**.
* Results will be totalled and announced **December 31st** (or Jan. 1st).

## How do I participate?
Simple: Submit a game to [the Content Database](https://content.minetest.net/) by the deadline with the `Jam / Community 2021` tag (coming soon).  

Packages will be held until work time ends and then approved to open for ratings.  

### Rules
* Game must be created within allotted time-frame
* Third-party libraries and assets may be used, but core gameplay must be own work
  * We **highly recommend** using git submodules for third-party libraries
* Teams are allowed (any size allowed, participants may participate in multiple teams and individually)
* CDB Packages must be tagged appropriately (event tag)
* Participants found unfairly influencing reviews will be **immediately disqualified**, but their package (if submitted) may remain as a regular CDB package

## Rating and Scoring
On **December 21st** all submissions will be approved (if they meet CDB guidelines) and opened for playing/rating.  

### Your Job
Play and review submission with the [event tag](#). Your +1/-1 will contribute to the community score for each package.  

### Our Job
A [panel of judges](#who-are-the-judges) will also score each package. This will be combined with the community score and objective rubric to produce a final score.  

Here are some subjective things you should keep in mind that the judges may be looking for.  
| Criteria      | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Innovation    | What's different about your game? Are the mechanics new and clever? Is there unexpected gameplay?               |
| Gameplay      | How intuitive is your gameplay? Is it a fun one-sitting game or hours of emergent gameplay? Is it captivating?  |
| Content       | Is your game super polished? Or is there a lot to explore?                                                      |
| Audio/Visuals | Did you make beautiful art or music? Is the game style cohesive? Can you charm anyone with your programmer art? |
| Stability     | How well does your game run? Are there any unexpected crashes? Are there any warnings in the console?           |

### Wait, objective rubric?
These are bonus criteria that will add to your score. Not completing these will probably harm your package in the final rankings.    

| Criteria                                                                                                             | Bonus |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| **The game is stable enough to play.**              <br> Any bugs or crashes should not hinder main gameplay.        | 5%    |
| **Package has a public <ins>git</ins> repository.** <br> Mercurial is cool, but we use git in this house.            | 3%    |
| **The game works out-of-the-box.**                  <br> No extra configuration, external programs, or trusted mods. | 2%    |

## What will I win?
Bragging rights! A cool game! Oh, and some money!  
The **top 3** winners will win portions of the prize pool.

Portions are subject to change, but you can expect roughly 50%/30%/20% for 1st/2nd/3rd.
