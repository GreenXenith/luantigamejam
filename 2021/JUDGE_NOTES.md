## Alter
> Interesting puzzle game in the same vein as ITB and Lightfield Labs. Overall well done. _(Benrob0329)_

> Portal from an *alter*nate universe. The quips are hilarious and the gameplay is simple but engaging. The puzzles are well-designed. I'd like to see larger puzzles, perhaps with other types of blocks that do different things when altered. _(GreenXenith)_

> What I saw of this game seemed pretty clever. Unfortunately, I got myself stuck on one level and did not find any way to restart it... Having to start the game over because you screwed up once on a level is just too harsh. Aesthetics are passible, but the game feels a bit unpolished currently. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Fun idea, played well. Got stuck, but could have been my own fault. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> Wonderful puzzle game, a unique premise and well executed plot _(MisterE)_

> Very well done. Good mechanics and I like the dialogue. There are a few unpolished bits, like the unchanged hand texture. Please continue this after the jam! _(rubenwardy)_

> perhaps too difficult (or I'm too stupid) _(sfan5)_

## Arcade 3D
> DIY Pacman game, really nothing more than that. _(Benrob0329)_

> It's 3D pacman, but there's nothing to play and the ghosts crash the game upon placement. _(GreenXenith)_

> This game somehow falls short of Pac-Man, a game released more than 40 years ago. Ghost AI, once a hallmark of the game's clever design, has been replaced with just making the ghosts walk in a straight line towards you. Not that the ghosts actually do anything, I spawned like 15 of them as a joke and they were thoroughly incapable of damaging me at all, let alone killing me. You have to manually click every pellet to pick them up, and sometimes this causes nearby level geometry to start flashing. I'm not sure how that will affect photosensitive players, I can only hope it doesn't. And then there's the very loud elephant in the room--the painful overlapping sound effects that play whenever you move. Oh yeah, it's kinda minor compared to everything else but also if you place the maze in the wrong spot it'll trap you in level geometry forever. You'll either have to turn on noclip or start an entirely new world to get out of that. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Game crashes on first launch, second time entering works, but you are given no items and need to manually get them with /giveme _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> I wanted pacman :| but it is a good start for pacman, keep up the good work! _(MisterE)_

> Nice graphics, but clunky gameplay and painful setup _(rubenwardy)_

## Balloonair
> Well made, arcade style flyer. Balloon moves a little too fast for the mapgen to keep up in my experience, but well done nonetheless. _(Benrob0329)_

> While I love the balloon model, colors, and the concept, the controls are difficult at best and it becomes nearly impossible if you go too low. At certain speeds the terrain can't generate fast enough. The UI is well-polished though. _(GreenXenith)_

> This is the most creative use of MT's natural mapgen I've seen in a game, to date. That, combined with the pastel aesthetic make for a really cool and unique-feeling game. However, I found that (at least on "factory default" settings) the game has a few problems. Since the terrain is an important part of gameplay, how well you can react depends heavily on draw distance and the speed your PC can generate the map. Similarly, items and birds feel like they spawn rather close to the balloon and give you little time to react to them which doesn't feel great. The other issue I had was that the balloon's hitbox feels kind of unclear. There were a lot of times where I expected to pick something up but didn't, which is always frustrating. Despite those issues I still definitely had a fun time with this, if you can find ways to fix these issues and keep working on this, I think you'll have a real gem on your hands. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Works well, includes ingame help. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> Simply zen and a great game. It does get too fast too quickly and start glitching out (not adding birds or coins). Love the creativity. _(MisterE)_

> I really like the graphics, it's beautiful! Kudos for making it all yourself. I found the gameplay quite painful, you could use some tooltips/HUD text for the different items _(rubenwardy)_

> good concept ruined by bugs _(sfan5)_

## Berzerkpt
> NES/2600 style "run around and hit things" type game. Nothing really new here, it's mostly just mobs + rooms. _(Benrob0329)_

> The environment was surprisingly immersive, but there isnt much gameplay. I found the doors didn't always work. There isn't really a goal or much challenge. A bigger city to run through with more goals would be interesting to see. _(GreenXenith)_

> This is...roughly the same idea as Jail Escape, except worse in every category. The labyrinth with destructible walls is replaced by 4 rooms you cycle through, enemies die in one hit and can inexplicably hit you from several feet away, you often spawn into rooms facing backwards, there's no win condition, no music, MTG-esque graphics... Regardless, I think this game has the potential to grow into something good in time. I'd recommend the author keep working on the game regardless of the score it gets. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Very repetitive, boring, lacks goals. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> The doors are hard to figure out, they dont always work. It needs more content and better intuitiveness _(MisterE)_

> I was confused by the doors to begin with, I'd suggest adding a corridoor. The gameplay is short, and repetitive. But I like the maps and the world building _(rubenwardy)_

## Blockbomber
> Genuinely fun multiplayer game based on Bomberman. _(Benrob0329)_

> Great visuals and sounds, decent UI. I found the controls to be confusing and the fall detector seemed a bit sensitive. The game concept is neat and the multiplayer competition is really fun to do no matter the control jankiness. Some more control polish in the future would be great. _(GreenXenith)_

> I was concerned going into this as a singleplayer-only dude, but I managed to get a few matches in and I had a lot of fun! The in-game instructions are clear and the game looks and sounds nice. I'd love to see bot players added for offline play and times where no-one's on, but this already feels like a pretty solid little game. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Very polished, multiplayer only. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> Very well done, would certainly suit a certain minigame server _(rubenwardy)_

> fun gameplay; ingame explanations definitely needed _(sfan5)_

## Build'N'Buy
> Fairly well put together, but not much that's interesting in terms of gameplay. Money only punishes you if you buy the wrong thing, and the act of copying another build right next to yours is only tedious. _(Benrob0329)_

> I cant say I enjoy running through a maze of a mall to buy blocks just to copy a build, but it is otherwise decent gameplay. There are a lot of builds to copy. The mall is difficult to navigate, and the slow walk speed doesn't help. _(GreenXenith)_

> I've only seen a small amount of MCC, but from what little I know I can tell that this game is missing the point of its inspiration. Build Mart works because it's a team-based race setting; it's a faster-paced game where you'll typically have someone shopping while the others build / inspect the other side, and there's an inherent challenge of finishing before the other teams do. But here we're in singleplayer, and the result is very boring: You look over a build, take some notes, go out shopping, go back to looking at the build, replicate, repeat. There's no real scoring system, money is never an issue, and some builds contain nodes hidden from view that you'll just have to guess... because of this, there's not really much point to playing. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Textures all pulled from Zughy Soothing TP. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> Just great. I love the shopping concept, and this seems to be very well polished. Wonderful choice of bgm. A larger build area would be nice. _(MisterE)_

> This isn't my type of game, I was bored. But it's well done _(rubenwardy)_

> timesink but not really "fun" _(sfan5)_

## Builda City
> Sim City type sandbox. Not a lot of depth here, but what is here is fun enough to mess around with. Could use some actual resource management. _(Benrob0329)_

> SimCity/CitySkylines in Minetest? Sign me up! The style is cohesive (Kenny assets are always a treat), though the colors are a bit monotonous. The placement system is fairly intuitive, though the removal system tends to break sometimes without explanation. The sounds fit well and the system works, though there isn't a lot of real gameplay. I'd love to see expansion on this from every angle in the future. I definitely think this can become something as complex as SimCity. _(GreenXenith)_

> Quite polished for a gamejam title. The gameplay is very limited right now, but I definitely like what I'm seeing so far and I hope to see it blossom into a full-blown city builder in time. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Models from Kenny, can't earn more than 100 coins. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> This is a great start to a city builder game. It just needs juice. As is, its a really interesting proof of concept. I could see having cars, buses, other transporation, mines, etc. (3d openTTD)  _(MisterE)_

> This is a nice prototype, shame there isn't much to do. I recommend having a tooltip for the different types of buildings, as I didn't know what they were _(rubenwardy)_

> promising concept but needs more _(sfan5)_

## Coconut Collection
> Slow and tedious macguffin game. _(Benrob0329)_

> What it says on the tin. You collect coconuts. No real goals though, and the collection process is extremely slow. The tool upgrade also doesn't let you select what you want, or tell you what each one costs (I figured it out from the CDB listing). _(GreenXenith)_

> Stopped at 5 coconuts due to wrist health concerns, had to take the rest of the day off from judging as a precaution _(Hugues Ross)_

> Executing the /call chat command crashes the game. Seems to include lots of unused assets and code. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> So, all you can do is go around and collect coconuts? hmm... its too hard to pick up the nuts, and I couldnt figure out what those boxes were for. If you want players to just go around and pick up nuts, then you will have to make it much more engaging using sound design and highscores. _(MisterE)_

> Gameplay isn't that interesting _(rubenwardy)_

## Colour Hop
> A puzzle sandbox with novel mechanics. Somewhat frustrating to build in, but interesting enough that I'd like to return to it. I'm not convinced that flying dragons are the best enemy for a game where you're stuck on the ground, but the progression of new mechanics and ability (and requirement) to make simple machines to help your fight works well enough. _(Benrob0329)_

> Such neat mechanics with lots of emergent gameplay. Unfortunately I lack the patience to figure most of it out, and the interaction with the world is extremely slow. Defeating a regular moving dragon with stationary fireworks is rather tricky, to say the least. I'd love to see this expanded upon with a potentially easier interaction system. _(GreenXenith)_

> Colour Hop has a bunch of neat emergent mechanics, a decent amount of content, good aesthetics, and a massive glaring flaw: It deliberately obfuscates its mechanics for no goddamn reason. The hallmark of a good puzzle game is giving the player interesting tools to work with and presenting them with problems that require clever applications of them. Colour Hop does the first half of that, then never tells the player what half of those tools do so the game gradually becomes an exercise in frustration where creativity is replaced by trial and error. It's unfortunate, this game probably would've gotten 2-3 more points out of me otherwise. _(Hugues Ross)_

> No help included ingame, and link isn't selectable text for easy copying. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> this is a new take on a block building game. The buildings you have to build could be better integrated into the game, as far as instructions or hints. But the base game is really well polished. Unfortunately the dragon just flies away. _(MisterE)_

> I liked the block effect and the fireworks, interesting idea but could be faster paced _(rubenwardy)_

> feels pointless even after figuring out the instructions _(sfan5)_

## Grand Theft Box
> Roads + The Bikes Mod _(Benrob0329)_

> The city surrounding is neat, but that's about it. The bike addition was really unnecessary when it was just covered with a cube. _(GreenXenith)_

> In its current state, this isn't really much of a game. You grab a box, ride around a little... and that appears to be it. The riding mechanics are not terribly exciting either, box speed and handling is very poor and sometimes you get stuck in walls. _(Hugues Ross)_

> You can drive a box around a street. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> nice job with the city textures, but then I couldnt figure out much point to the game... _(MisterE)_

> Box physics is pretty awful, with no handling. There doesn't seem to be much gameplay at all _(rubenwardy)_

> crashes _(sfan5)_

## Holiday Horrors
> This feels like it could have been a decent little arcade "Where's Waldo" type game, but the scale of where you have to search and the fact that you cannot realistically fight enemies makes it impossible to complete. The lack of front-to-back experience (if you die, you respawn outside of the game) tells me that little testing was put into this, and the media is even miscredited because the author couldn't be bothered to check The Infinite IKEA's package creator. _(Benrob0329)_

> It has gameplay but not much else going for it. Finding the special present is mostly just tedium, and the chat hints aren't very helpful when they give mixed directions and the aisles arent labeled. _(GreenXenith)_

> This game is an agonizingly dull exercise in frustration. First of all, if you die you respawn outside of the level and have to create an entirely new world to keep playing. The only monster type is very basic and nothing about its design relates to the theme of the game. Worse, they can hit you through walls! But what about the 'meat' of the game? Ultimately, this is a game about walking arounf a warehouse in search of a single green present. You're basically looking for a needle in a haystack while weird purple things harass you. After a while, I decided to cheat and try finding the present with flying and noclip. Easy, right? Well, after roughly half an hour of inspecting shelves I wasn't entirely sure that the green present even existed. After several more maps and looking at the code, I've come to the conclusion that the green present can exist, but that a map can also simply spawn without any (by placing them where the walls and shelves will go)... You can very well be softlocked straight from the first second of playtime. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Copied all of MTG for a handful of items. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> How about better help finding the special present (there arent any isle numbers), and more game depth? Interesting concept though _(MisterE)_

## Jail Escape
> It's a maze game, but with trash, pop, and dynamite. Most of the work seems to just be the Labyrinth game. _(Benrob0329)_

> Essentially Labyrinth but prison themed. The enemies were good enough to fight. The generated trash cans and vending machines were a neat addition. The maze itself is rather bland, it barely resembles a prison (prisons aren't even mazes but whatever). I'm not fond of first-person mazes myself, but it seemed like the enemies increased rank the closer you got, which helped. Including the recorded dialogue was humorous :) _(GreenXenith)_

> I think this is a really neat twist of existing content for minetest, taking familiar pieces and combining them into something new and fresh feeling. My main complaint is that success is highly RNG dependent - In my first run I didn't get any weapons at all, whereas in my second I was swimming in them... there are also a couple bugs, like picked up items being inaccessible if your hotbar is full and enemies killing you while you're in the main menu. But overall, I'm kinda into this. I'd like to see it mature more.  _(Hugues Ross)_

> pretty good maze runner. Really adds depth to the maze. as far as the theme goes, it was well executed. It could have done better with instructions and the goal. _(MisterE)_

> Stepping out into the void is a bit of a let down of an ending, but it's decent maze RNG game otherwise. More polish and content would be good _(rubenwardy)_

## Lazarr!
> Small puzzle game leaning on some pieces of MTG and Xdecor. Decently well put together, with a simple core mechanic. My one gripe is the dang screwdriver. _(Benrob0329)_

> A simple puzzle experience. Enjoyable if it weren't for the blasted screwdriver. Fortunately I am used to the screwdriver so it didn't bother me much, but there must be a more intuitive way to rotate those mirrors. The actual laser visuals were neat. Level 9 is impossible to solve, so I had to skip it. It would also be nice if the time was locked to day, as solving puzzles at night was very difficult. I appreciate the pirate pun :) _(GreenXenith)_

> This game should be good. Sadly it isn't, and almost entirely as a result of its awful UX. Initially I thought the game was broken because I couldn't interact with anything, and had to go into the game's reviews to figure out how to actually play the game at all. That should've been the end of my troubles, but the screwdriver is a huge pain in the ass to use and feels extremely unintuitive. It would make perfect sense if it just rotated the block around the axis you clicked on, but it does something else that I'm unable to understand or predict. Instead, I just found myself walking around mirrors spam-clicking them until they arbitrarily reached the orientation I wanted. It's a shame, this would be a genuinely neat little puzzle game if not for these issues. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Relaxing brain teasers. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> neat concept. Horrible that we have to use a screwriver :P Could use a lot more polish, and better storytelling. A little buggy though, such that I cold not finish a more complicated level _(MisterE)_

> This is nice. I'd suggest adding more effects and a level complete animation - perhaps red particles coming from the goal - rather than transitioning immediately. I'd also suggest having the lasers be on from the start, it results in a nicer effect _(rubenwardy)_

> just missing some polish _(sfan5)_

## Little Lady
> Charming little platformer made with (mostly) canned assets. The recorded piano pieces are a fantastic touch, though I do feel that Autobox generated collision boxes do their toll here. The game recommends disabling node selection boxes, and ignoring the fact that it could have defined its own (or disabled them entirely), I felt that they were completely needed to be able to know where I could and could not jump/walk up surfaces. With some clean up of said collision boxes, I think that this could be a nice little experience _(Benrob0329)_

> Amazing idea with amazing visuals. The only hinderance is the climbing mechanic. I had to keep selectionboxes on to be able to figure out where to go at all, since what is climable and what isn't is not very obvious. I know autobox is your baby, but I'm not sure it's the right tool for the job here :) The UI is very polished and the story is very cute. The models are also cool, though some deserve more texturing and detail (that rake though..) _(GreenXenith)_

> I really want to like this more than I do. I think the decision to build a game around navigating a highly organic environment was really ambitious, I love the aesthetics a lot too... but the gameplay is just too jank in practice. I stopped midway through 'field trip' because the constant lurching that happens due to the hitboxes in the environment was starting to make me feel a little bit motion sick, and I kinda soured over time on the game because of the movement and star hitboxes. If not for that this would probably be my top pick _(Hugues Ross)_

> Nice to see Minetest used for something that ISN'T a voxel game. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> Just so cute. Its a little tedious to climb the (now invisible (if you follow the instructions) ) node boxes. Its has a great concept and is reasonably well executed considering the engine limitations. _(MisterE)_

> The music was really good, and fitting _(rubenwardy)_

> great art, but collision detection :( _(sfan5)_

## LuckyDude
> You're stuck in a small room with a lottery machine: the game. _(Benrob0329)_

> Simple, cute, no skill involved though. There may be a way to add complex rule systems to determine which block is last. The UX, visuals, and sound is polished. _(GreenXenith)_

> This is purely a game of chance, where you arbitrarily gain and lose points according to luck. Some effort was put into the presentation, but it doesn't change that this is barely a game to begin with. The help mentions that there's only one level so far, but I don't see what future levels would add to the concept to begin with. This does not have good bones. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Punch random blocks to get points. No rhyme or reason, just pure luck. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> This does not deserve to be called a game. However, it just ticked many of the boxes on my subjective ruberic. It does not deserve it's high score. Totally recommended.  _(MisterE)_

> Not really a game _(rubenwardy)_

## Minegistic
> This, this is not a game. This is the start of a mod, or perhaps a game, but it's nowhere near having any actual gameplay. _(Benrob0329)_

> If this were more complete, I feel like it could go somewhere. The resource collection and transfer system is cool, though I could not seem to convert resources into money, thus stopping my progress. _(GreenXenith)_

> The game doesn't seem to work, and with no extra polish or indication of what it's meant to do I can't really award this any points for what's there either. I'm happy to try this again and review it in the future, but today I can't really give it a score _(Hugues Ross)_

> Entering game shows devtest message. Store node appears to be broken. Cart doesn't transport goods. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> I could not place tracks (I think it was the unknown item in the inventory) _(MisterE)_

> Doesn't appear to be anything to do _(rubenwardy)_

> ??? _(sfan5)_

## Modular Portals
> Interesting concept piece, but it lacks any depth. The portals themselves are pulled off decently well, though the teleportation is a bit jarring. _(Benrob0329)_

> Modular portals is a neat concept, and the execution of the portals themselves was surprisingly smooth. While I did manage to "complete" the game, just guessing portal designs from context clues is a bit difficult to understand. The portal mechanics are great, they just need some more intentional gameplay to go with it. The transition in looped rooms was perfectly smooth, but the transition between other rooms was not quite as smooth (perhaps this could be fixed?). _(GreenXenith)_

> Ok, this is quite neat! I wasn't expecting to be able to see through a portal into the same room, with visible block changes and everything. I also appreciate how many portals are set up to 'suggest' valid combinations, it makes the game feel a lot smoother than it oherwise would. Could use more polish, but this is a neat mechanic _(Hugues Ross)_

> Techdemo? Is there actually a goal/objective. I couldn't find one. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> This was an amazing concept. I had a lot of fun going from one room to... itself. It needs in-game hints, though. _(MisterE)_

> Nice mechanic and nice art. I'd like to see it made into more of a game - perhaps you're trying to escape and have to solve puzzles _(rubenwardy)_

> promising concept _(sfan5)_

## Moontest
> Honestly, surprising. This feels reminiscent of mid-2000s resource management Flash games, both in it's gameplay and in it's style. It's got that kind of terribly charming med-res feel, with a HUD that feels more technical than it probably needs to be. It's decently difficult, and I can see it maturing into quite a nice multiplayer game with some extra depth. Having the instructions show up on first join might be a must, though. _(Benrob0329)_

> This would have fit perfectly for the Ludum Dare 49 game jam ("Unstable" theme). The high-poly models fit well in the space, and the sounds are very immersive. The instructions were rather confusing and information-dense (I am not going to decipher the stability calculations), but the gist of it made enough sense. Though the game can be frustrating, I found myself retrying at least a few times before I gave up. If there was an end goal, I did not reach it :) I found if you go into debt at all, digging yourself out is nigh impossible due to inability to obtain food, thus losing $2000 regularly. The aliens are fun, even if they dont fit the look quite right. Hitting an enemy puts the remains in the first slot which is usually the one you fight with, which stops you from fighitng until you switch slots. Also I wish I could use the hovercrafts :] _(GreenXenith)_

> I got the impression from the instructions that this was meant to be a slow-paced game where you carefully balance your needs against available resources. In practice though, my experience was just sprinting around whacking constantly breaking machines and occasionally punching the infinitely-respawning aliens. It kinda sucks imo, but it's stable, unique, and has a reasonable aesthetic so it gets a "good enough" score. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Some textures render poorly due to being such high resolution. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> It really immerses you in the persona of a commercial astronaut. It needs more content, and better ways to understand what to do and when.  _(MisterE)_

> I liked the models, but the gameplay was just running around fixing red stuff and guessing numbers _(rubenwardy)_

> gameplay = stress simulator _(sfan5)_

## Parkour
> Simple and to the point, but well made and polished. _(Benrob0329)_

> Certainly not a new concept, but this is a clever use of it. Adding a puzzle aspect to the game definitely makes the parkour experience better. The slime blocks blend in with the floor as well. It would be nice if hitting the floor caused an automatic restart. _(GreenXenith)_

> Well, it is a game that exists _(Hugues Ross)_

> A restart level button on the ground would be a nice addition. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> Simple concept that has been done before, but its well executed here. Nice textures, simple theme, reasonable number of features. Could use more levels. _(MisterE)_

> Doesn't appear to be a way to restart the level if you fall off _(rubenwardy)_

## Snake 3D
> It's snake, but in 3D and with jarring controls. _(Benrob0329)_

> While the concept is interesting, the execution did not appeal to me. Snake operates on seeing the entire arena. The 1st person perspective really doesn't let you see much, and can almost be sickening at times. I also found it difficult to tell when I was going to hit a wall. _(GreenXenith)_

> Exactly what it says on the tin, it's snake but in 3D. For a game like this, good 3Cs and aesthetics need to do a lot of heavy lifting but here they're both somewhat lacking. No bugs that I could find though, so this score is mainly a result of the minimal polish and relatively simple/boring concept rather than the technical aspects. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Its jerky and hard to see and steer. A good thing is the textures though. _(MisterE)_

> Controls were awful, but interesting idea and clean graphics _(rubenwardy)_

> unfortunately hard to control/use _(sfan5)_

## Solar Plains: Invector
> All spit-shine and no actual gameplay. I know Jordach put a lot of time into this one, but I can't help but feel that more of his time should have been spent focussing on the gameplay, and less on the mostly unused soundtrack for a much bigger game than the jam's timeframe would allow him to create. _(Benrob0329)_

> Extremely polished visuals with some basic racing gameplay, but nothing past racing infinite laps. Even just a 3-lap win condition would have helped immensely. The powerup icons aren't very intuitive, in both design and in function (why would a mese crystal give me a speed boost?) The trigger detection for boosts/items didn't always work, perhaps due to an unexpectedly small detection area or missing a step. It goes without saying more interesting tracks would be neat. _(GreenXenith)_

> This game's got a lot of jank and no win state, but I'm frankly amazed that you actually found the time to put in basic kart racer AI in the time you had and that it usually feels about right! I'd love to see the singleplayer get tightened up more and expanded to a proper campaign. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Includes 20MB of .blend1 files YAY! Lacks a goal and any scoring. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> Wow, just wow. Love the sound effects and that it has AI that works reasonably well. I would suggest changing the "fire" button to jump or sneak (you could simulate using the item) _(MisterE)_

> The models and graphics are very good, but unfortunately ultimately let down by limitations of the MT engine.  _(rubenwardy)_

> great audiovisuals; ingame explanations would be helpful _(sfan5)_

## spMeTeR
> This seems to be an attempted RPG, but with a severe lack of content. There are clearly other areas here, but it doesn't seem like you can access them. Mud monsters and a pointy stick are about all that can be seen here, though I do hope it turns into a little Adventure like experience someday. _(Benrob0329)_

> The modular room concept is interesting, but without any form of barrier between them, I found monsters tend to wander in while in the shop menu. It also crashed on first start. Grinding and crafting was a rather lengthy endeavor, and the reward wasn't worth it, especially when you don't know what to do with the items you craft. The rock didn't seem to do anything special? The last room also wasn't accessible. Interesting start. _(GreenXenith)_

> All you can really do is walk back and forth poking cubes that make clanking noises until you get, like, 60 bucks at which point you can craft an entire rock that you can ineffectually toss once. There's the tantalizing promise of a 3rd dungeon room with lava in it, but I was unable to access this without noclip and it doesn't appear to contain anything of note. Consistently crashes on first launch. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Walking around works, that's about it. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> The start of the game went well. But soon I realized that all there was to do was fight dirt monsters. It looks like this is the start of an immersive room-by-room rpg or dungeon crawler. If it had content, it really could have worked.  _(MisterE)_

> Not much to do, would like to see further development on an RPG game _(rubenwardy)_

## Stella
> Resource gathering game, could be called a "clicker" pretty easily. I'm interesting to know if there will be any actual strategy here, but from the looks of it there will just be more progression of the same kind added in the future. _(Benrob0329)_

> Hexagons are the bestagons. Great tech demo, not a ton of interesting gameplay. The concept is there, but the visuals and tedium make it more of an idle time-burner than a fun game. Some story or interesting reason would help, coupled with some visuals for what exactly I am building here. _(GreenXenith)_

> This reminds me a lot of Castrum, one of this dev's other games. I think the hexagons are a neat choice and the smaller playing area makes the game a lot less tedious to me. On the other hand, there's a bunch of stuff that I'm not as fond of... for starters, this feels like an idle game that you cannot be idle in. Instead, you end up camping resource locations and occasionally holding down the mouse to make them go into your inventory. That sort of constant extended mouse button holding is not great for wrist health, but thankfully it's not too long here and depositing resources gives you a break so it mostly works out. This still leaves the feeling that it's too active to be an idle game but too passive to be anything else. I see this as an issue, but given the interesting design choices and early dev stage I'm willing to give it more leeway here. I'll be interested to see where this ends up. _(Hugues Ross)_

> Does what it claims to do, but last about ten minutes. Harvesting the pillars is slightly buggy. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> This looks like it could become an interesting game. However, it is buggy to the point of unplayablility, as is. _(MisterE)_

> Nice concept for the map. Gameplay is ultimately not very fun - just grinding. I think this could be an interesting strategy game, like a blend of skyblock and Hades _(rubenwardy)_

## Subway Miner
> A very novel runner game in the same style as Subway Surfer and Temple Run. Honestly surprised that this got pulled off in MT as well as it did. _(Benrob0329)_

> A surprisingly well-executed Subway Surfer game. The visuals mesh well together, and the sound choices are satisfying. The UI is also well-polished. The collision tolerance felt a little low; at a certain speed it was nearly impossible to get past a set of cars that were super close together. It would also be cool to see vertical changes and a surrounding environment. _(GreenXenith)_

> At some point I passed out, and when I came to my run count was hovering around 50. Had a lot of fun with this, only complaint is the relatively low amount of map variations and the really janky-feeling slide timing. I hope to see this grow and improve further, it's fun! _(Hugues Ross)_

> Fun, get's repetitive, but saved highscores give something to try and beat. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> Really fun, especially after the music. I would suggest enabling music by default and having the option to disable it. I almost missed enabling the music; it would have gotten a slightly lower score. It is slightly buggy but its has great replay value. _(MisterE)_

> Very well done and polished. I'd suggest allowing W/S for jump and duck though _(rubenwardy)_

## survivethedays
> Not really a game either. There is mapgen, and monsters, but not really an idea of what would have made this different even if it had been completed. _(Benrob0329)_

> Interesting concept, but not much in the way of gameplay. The textures are interesting, but don't seem to fit quite right (and there are some missing media errors). I appreciate the easy mode joke. _(GreenXenith)_

> My first impression was something like "Huh, this is a really weird aesthetic but I kinda dig it", then 5 seconds later I was dead for no apparent reason. I respawned next to a black spiny ??? that was spinning and vibrating in place, and had to be punched two dozen times to kill. I wish I could say more about this game, but I've yet to find anything else to say. Aside from weird black spiky things and foliage that prevents you from seeing the weird black spiky things, there doesn't seem to be anything at all. _(Hugues Ross)_

> MTG with two added mods. Mapgen broken, eternal falling. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> I loved the joke regarding the easy level, and totally fell for it. But other than that, it seems it has nothing... maybe it is buggy with placing a schematic? _(MisterE)_

> Map generation and graphics were nice _(rubenwardy)_

## TowerDefense
> A neat concept sniped by time and over-polishing issues given how busy Auri is. _(Benrob0329)_

> Beautiful visuals, but I couldn't figure out how to place anything (except for in exactly one spot that had some item dropped in it). The map looks rather odd with all of the placement zones marked individually, there may be a better way to do that. The custom hotbar is neat, though it took me a minute or two to figure out shift to select horizontally. The enemies look neat, though a group of them got stuck on the path. _(GreenXenith)_

> Impressive visuals, but how to play isn't clear to me and there are apparently no instructions. Enemies get very confused if you stand in front of them. Game crashed twice during testing. No audio _(Hugues Ross)_

> Segfaults Minetest, map copying instructions are unclear. Can't do anything once the map stuff is copied. _(Nathan Salapat/MinetestVideos)_

> unfortunatly I could not get this to run at all. At first it just crashed silently, then it put me in an empty world and let me fall infinitely. Really looking forward to the first release of this game, as it seems that it will be great! _(MisterE)_

> You took a risk by choosing an ambitious idea, and unfortunately wasn't able to pull it off. The graphics were very good and I liked the novel item selection HUD. Map setup was annoying, would prefer a schematic-based generator. I couldn't work out how to place anything and there were dev nodes everywhere _(rubenwardy)_

> crashes on startup, no gameplay but promising concept, good art _(sfan5)_
