3 days left for the Minetest GAME JAM! Start wrapping up and submit whatever you have before Dec 22, UTC, even if it isn't quite done (mark as WIP).
Make sure to add your packages and releases to the ContentDB with the Jam / Game 2021 tag!

## December 21 (finish)
Work time for the 2021 Minetest GAME JAM is OVER! BUT ... you have an extra hour to get your packages submitted for review (or fix any huge bugs you missed).
When packages are approved in 10 days ago, it will be time for you to go play and review submissions at https://content.minetest.net/packages/?q=&tag=jam_game_2021! 

### Rate
Submission time is (officially) done\*! You now have 10 days to play and review submissions! ⚖️ 
https://content.minetest.net/packages/?tag=jam_game_2021&random=1
We've received a total of 24\*\* submissions! Thats a lot of games :D Also, the final prize pool total is $720! Thank you to all those that contributed to the jam and the prize pool!

\* You may still adjust non-game components such as licensing, readmes, or other CDB technical issues. Review time is also subject to possible extension.
\*\* Some games are still in the review process. Check back ever so often to see if new games have been added to the list! 

Note: If your game literally does not start, bug fixes for that are OK.
