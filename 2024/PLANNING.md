## Theme

There is no theme! Creative starting points will be provided.

> But a theme prevents people from working before the deadline!

Well, no, it's pretty easy to make a whole jam game and then mold it to the theme once it is announced. Honor system.  

> Restriction breeds creativity! We need a theme!

It *can* breed creativity. It can also cause participants to overthink or keep them from coming up with relevant ideas. But yes, themes help many come up with ideas faster so they can focus on making games. Instead of a strict theme, creative prompts will be provided for those that want something quick to start with.  

> The theme sucks!

Welcome back.  

## Content Requirements
* Games must comply with [ContentDB policies](https://content.minetest.net/policy_and_guidance/)
* Gameplay must be original work created within the allotted timeframe
* Third-party libraries and assets may be used (and are encouraged!)
* AI-generated content (code or media) are **not allowed**, see previous item
* Modules must use the `gamename_modname` naming convention for non-library mods (and everything must follow the [Right to a Name policy](https://content.minetest.net/policy_and_guidance/#31-right-to-a-name))
* `Complex Installation`, lack of source control, and use of non-free licenses will result in penalties

## Submission Process
* Games must be uploaded to the [Minetest Content Database](https://content.minetest.net/) **with the `Jam / Game 2024` tag**
* Games must be submitted **and approved** BEFORE the submission window closes; **submissions will not be accepted after the window closes**
* It is recommended to submit your game as early as possible in the approval window for your package must reach an approved state by the end of the window (you can technically submit your game late in the approval window, but you will be given less time to fix issues)
* Games can be submitted for approval at any time within the approval window (working period + 24 hours) but they will not be approved until after the working period

## Scoring
The community will log in to https://jam.minetest.net/rating/ (with ContentDB OAuth) to sort a randomized list of submissions in whatever way they wish. Reviewers' ranking for their own submission(s) is discarded. A set of "Best of" badges will also be provided for selecting outstanding packages.  

The placement for each package determines points it recieves (from 1 to \<total submissions>). Points recieved from reviewers with more than 10 helpful review points recieved on ContentDB (or have Editor rank or higher) will be increased by 10% (point threshold and bonus are subject to change). The final score (additive, +penalties) determines final ranking.

| Consider | |
| - | - |
| Gameplay   | How intuitive and enjoyable is the gameplay? Is it a fulfilling experience? Is there a clear goal? |
| Innovation | What makes the game unique? Does it have emergent mechanics or clever gameplay? |
| Content    | Is the game well-polished or packed with stuff to do? Is the art and sound consistent and cohesive? |

| Penalties | Reduces final score by 20% each (additive) |
| - | - |
| `Complex Installation` tag | Game should not require external libraries or mod trust. |
| No git repository | Game should use proper source control. |
| Non-free media or license | Game should use completely free assets and licenses. |

Packages with identical scores will be ranked according to the following (in order until determined):
* Average placement from helpful reviewers
* Number of penalties (less is better)
* Package ID (time submitted)
