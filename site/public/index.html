                <h1>Content Rules</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>All gameplay must be original and created during the development timeframe</li>
                    <li>Games must comply with <a href="https://content.minetest.net/policy_and_guidance/" target="_blank">ContentDB policies</a></li>
                    <li><em>Freely-licensed</em> libraries and assets from third-parties may be used (and is encouraged!)</li>
                    <li>AI-generated content (code, media, etc) is <strong>not allowed</strong>, see previous item</li>
                    <li>Boilerplate is fine, but existing games should not be used as a base</li>
                    <li>Games must be able to run on the latest version of Luanti (5.10.0, if released by November)</li>
                    <li>First-party modules must use the <code>gamename_modname</code> name convention (unmodified third-party modules may keep their name, see also <a href="https://content.minetest.net/policy_and_guidance/#31-right-to-a-name" target="_blank">Right to a Name policy</a>)</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Submission Process</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Submit games to <a href="https://content.minetest.net/">ContentDB</a> using the <code>Jam / Game 2024</code> tag</li>
                    <li>Games must be submitted <strong>and approved</strong> BEFORE the approval window closes (late submissions will be denied)</li>
                    <li>You can technically finish your game in the last 24 hours of the approval window, you just risk losing approval time</li>
                    <li>Games may be submitted for approval at any time within the approval window (Nov 1 - 23); Earlier is better</li>
                    <li>Groups/teams may participate (all members must be included in the <code>Maintainers</code> ContentDB field)</li>
                    <li>Participants may have multiple submissions</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Theme</h1>
                <p>There is no theme! Creative starting points will be provided.</p>

                <blockquote>But a theme prevents people from working before the deadline!</blockquote>
                <p>Well, no. It's pretty easy to make most of a game and then mold it to the theme once announced. Honor system.</p>
                
                <blockquote>Restriction breeds creativity! We need a theme!</blockquote>
                <p>Restriction <em>can</em> breed creativity. It can also cause participants to overthink or keep them from coming up with relevant ideas. But yes, themes help many come up with ideas faster so they can focus on making games. Instead of a strict theme, creative prompts will be provided for those that want something quick to start with.</p>

                <blockquote>The theme sucks!</blockquote>
                <p>Welcome back.</p>

                <h1>Scoring</h1>
                <p>
                    Scoring is <strong>entirely community-driven.</strong> Using <a href="/rating" class="important">an interface on this website</a>, anyone with a ContentDB account may log in to participate, allowing everyone to have a voice in the outcome.
                </p>
                <h2>How?</h2>
                <p>
                    Each reviewer will be presented with a randomly sorted list of all submissions to sort (from favorite to least-favorite). The average rank of each package (after automatic penalties) determines its final score. Jam participants can rank every package aside from their own.<br><br>
                    Rankings from members who have received <em>10 or more total "helpful review" points</em> on ContentDB (or have the <code>Editor</code> rank or higher) will have an <strong>added 10% weight</strong>. These are sort of like "mini-judges".<br><br>
                    Badges will also be provided to be assigned to your favorite games for 6 categories: <em>Most Innovative, Most Fun, Best Graphics, Best Audio, Best Humor, and Best Mood</em>. Packages with the most of a badge will be considered the winner in that category (for glory).
                </p>
